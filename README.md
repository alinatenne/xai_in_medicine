# XAI in Medicine: Python Case Study
Contains a finetuned ResNet50 by **Ashkay Kumaar M.** and three Explanation Algorithm: IG, GradCAM and LRP.

## Dataset
The dataset used to train the model and to explain the model behaviour is the [brain tumor dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427) posted by **Jun Cheng** on [figshare.com](figshare.com).

This brain tumor dataset containing 3064 T1-weighted contrast-inhanced images from 233 patients with three kinds of brain tumor: meningioma (708 slices), glioma (1426 slices), and pituitary tumor (930 slices).

## Modules
This repository contains
* [Testversion](ResNet50_Tumor_Classifier_and_Explainer_Testversion.ipynb), which has been used for the evaluation of implementation. This version is shortened and has some adjustments for interview reasons.
* Tumor Explainer and Classifier, which is the associated Jupyter Notebook to the results of my masters thesis.

## About
This project has been done by Alina Tenne. References can be found in the associated master's thesis or for implementation techniques and dataset information, in the Jupyter Notebook.
